# JSON to SQLite Converter

This Python script (`script.py`) converts JSON data to an SQLite database and saves it as `sqlite.db`.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

2. Install the required libraries `pandas` and `sqlite3` by running the following commands:
```
pip install pandas
pip install pysqlite3
```

3. Place your JSON file in the same directory as `script.py` and name it `input.json`. If your JSON file has a different name, modify the `json_file_path` variable in the `script.py` file accordingly.

## Usage

1. Run the script by executing the following command in the terminal:
```
python script.py
```

2. The script will read the JSON data from the `input.json` file, convert it to an SQLite database using the `pandas` and `sqlite3` libraries, and save it as `sqlite.db` in the same directory.

3. Once the script finishes execution, you will find the `sqlite.db` file in the same directory, containing the converted SQLite database.

## Note

This script does not require any external web server or Flask app to convert JSON to SQLite. It directly performs the conversion and saves the SQLite database file locally.

Please make sure you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the directory where the script is executed.

That's it! You can now use the `script.py` script to easily convert JSON data to an SQLite database. If you encounter any issues or have any questions, feel free to reach out for assistance. Happy converting!
